# About the dataset:
The dataset includes the following features: Size, Weight, Sweetness, Crunchiness, Juiciness, Ripeness, Acidity, along with their corresponding values.

# About the code and model training:
I performed classification using TensorFlow and sklearn together. I classified apples into 'good(1)' and 'bad(0)' categories and trained the model accordingly.
I also use the Early Stop metric to prevent overfitting
